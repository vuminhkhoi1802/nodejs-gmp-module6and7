# Node.js GMP Khoi Vu Module 6 & 7

### Summary

In this project, instead of following all the pre-requisites in previous modules, I had altered the requirement by simplifying it just to create two entities: User & Role with many-to-many relationship.

### Requirement
- [NodeJS version 14](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker & DockerCompose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- A `.env` file (Will be provided separately)


### Instructions:
- Clone this repo
- Copy & paste the `.env` provided by me to the root directory of this project
- Execute the following commands in two separate terminal windows

```
$ docker-compose up

$ npm run start
```
